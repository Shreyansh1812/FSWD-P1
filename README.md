# FSWD Practical-01
## Challenges and Learnings During the Lab
### Challenges:


1. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Ensured functions like `filter` and `reduce` handled data without unintended side effects.

2. **Syntax Errors:**
   - Debugged minor issues in arrow functions and method usage.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Addressed scenarios like empty arrays or missing genres.

4. **Template Literals:**
   - Focused on proper formatting for displaying movie details.



## Learnings:

1. Mastered `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for dynamic operations.
2. Gained clarity on immutability and handling data safely.
3. Used template literals for clean, readable output.
4. Improved debugging skills and code structuring.

**Summary:** This lab solidified key JavaScript concepts and practical problem-solving skills.
